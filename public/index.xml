      <title>K Nearest Neighbour Sentiment Analysis with Gzip Embeddings</title>

      <description>Abstract This code implements a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) sentiment analysis model using normalized compression distance embeddings, applied to the Sentiment &amp;amp; Emotions Labelled Tweets dataset. The dataset consists of labeled tweets categorized into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. The code preprocesses the data by cleaning text and converting sentiment labels into numerical values. It then splits the data into training and testing sets. A compression distance normalization method is employed to calculate the normalized compression distances between pairs of tweets.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll be answering the following questions along the way:&#xA;1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time? 2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average? 3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks? 4.) What was the correlation between different stocks&#39;? 5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock? 6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?</description>

      <title>Visual Transformer from Scratch for Pneumonia Detection</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/vit/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/vit/</guid>
      <description>Abstract This code implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, comprising custom layers such as PreNorm, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Attention, and Transformer, along with data preprocessing functions. The ViT model architecture consists of patch embedding, positional embedding, multi-head self-attention mechanism, and a multi-layer perceptron for feature extraction and classification. The code also includes functions for loading and preprocessing image data from a given dataset.</description>
