      <description>Abstract This code implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification, comprising custom layers such as PreNorm, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Attention, and Transformer, along with data preprocessing functions. The ViT model architecture consists of patch embedding, positional embedding, multi-head self-attention mechanism, and a multi-layer perceptron for feature extraction and classification. The code also includes functions for loading and preprocessing image data from a given dataset. Training is performed using Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, with validation accuracy monitored during training.</description>
