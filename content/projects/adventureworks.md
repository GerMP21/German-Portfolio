## Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budgets) was provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.

**DimDate:**
``` sql
-- Cleansed DIM_Date Table --
SELECT 
  [DateKey], 
  [FullDateAlternateKey] AS Date, 
  [EnglishDayNameOfWeek] AS Day, 
  [EnglishMonthName] AS Month, 
  Left([EnglishMonthName], 3) AS MonthShort,
  [MonthNumberOfYear] AS MonthNo, 
  [CalendarQuarter] AS Quarter, 
  [CalendarYear] AS Year
FROM 
 [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimDate]
WHERE 
  CalendarYear >= 2022
  AND CalendarYear < 2024
```

**DimCustomer:**
``` sql
-- Cleansed DIM_Customers Table --
SELECT 
  c.customerkey AS CustomerKey, 
  c.firstname AS [First Name], 
  c.lastname AS [Last Name], 
  c.firstname + ' ' + lastname AS [Full Name],
  CASE c.gender WHEN 'M' THEN 'Male' WHEN 'F' THEN 'Female' END AS Gender,
  c.datefirstpurchase AS DateFirstPurchase, 
  g.city AS [Customer City] -- Joined in Customer City from Geography Table
FROM 
  [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimCustomer] as c
  LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimGeography] AS g ON g.geographykey = c.geographykey 
ORDER BY 
  CustomerKey ASC -- Ordered List by CustomerKey
```

**DimProduct:**
``` sql
-- Cleansed DIM_Products Table --
SELECT 
  p.[ProductKey], 
  p.[ProductAlternateKey] AS ProductItemCode, 
  p.[EnglishProductName] AS [Product Name], 
  psc.EnglishProductSubcategoryName AS [Sub Category], -- Joined in from Sub Category Table
  pc.EnglishProductCategoryName AS [Product Category], -- Joined in from Category Table
  p.[Color] AS [Product Color], 
  p.[Size] AS [Product Size], 
  p.[ProductLine] AS [Product Line], 
  p.[ModelName] AS [Product Model Name], 
  p.[EnglishDescription] AS [Product Description], 
  ISNULL (p.Status, 'Outdated') AS [Product Status] 
FROM 
  [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimProduct] as p
  LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimProductSubcategory] AS psc ON psc.ProductSubcategoryKey = p.ProductSubcategoryKey 
  LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimProductCategory] AS pc ON psc.ProductCategoryKey = pc.ProductCategoryKey 
order by 
  p.ProductKey asc
```

**FactInternetSales:**
``` sql
-- Cleansed FACT_InternetSales Table --
SELECT 
  [ProductKey], 
  [OrderDateKey], 
  [DueDateKey], 
  [ShipDateKey], 
  [CustomerKey], 
  [SalesOrderNumber], 
  [SalesAmount]
FROM 
  [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[FactInternetSales]
WHERE 
  LEFT (OrderDateKey, 4) >= YEAR(GETDATE()) - 2 -- Ensures we always only bring two years of date from extraction
  AND LEFT (OrderDateKey, 4) < '2024' -- Filter out sales before 2024
ORDER BY
  OrderDateKey ASC
```
